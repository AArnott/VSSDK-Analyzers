#### Problem statement
A clear and concise description of what the problem or anti-pattern is. Please include sample code snippets, and an explanation as to why it's an anti-pattern. How many times have you observed this in the wild?

#### Proposed solution
Describe the general patterns that the analyzer would recognize and whether an automated code fix might be offered. Do any patterns exist that are allowable yet very close to the anti-pattern that we should write negative tests for?
